# Data-Management-Fundamentals
## This course is an Introduction to Big Data

Learning Goals & Outcomes

Learned to model, cleanse, normalize, shard, map, query and analyze substantial real-world data (230mb+);

Understood the data cleansing, normalization and sharding processes by writing PYTHON scripts to process and converted the data to first (cleansed) CSV and then (normalized) SQL;

Designed and implemented a relational (MySQL) database and then wrote a PYTHON script to pipe (import) the cleansed data into the appropriate tables ensuring all integrity constraints are met.

Constructed and implemented a set of SQL queries to extract data using various filters and constraints.

Mapped (forward engineer) the data to a NoSQL database of your choice (MongoDB)

Wrote a short, reflective report on the learning outcomes you have achieved.

Got exposure to and learned the use of a range of data oriented technologies (databases, python & sql.)

Learned and use the MARKDOWN markup syntax.

The data is enclosed in a zip folder as it was too large to be uploaded
