# Description
Looking back and reflecting on the first DMF class and now, I've gone from a clueless student to learning how to model, cleanse, normalize, shad, map, query and analyze data. I have a good understanding on how to process (model, cleanse, normalize, shad, map, query and analyze data) using python scripts and how to design and implement a relational database (MYSQl) and use a python script to import the SQL into appropriate tables. Also I've learnt how to model, create a collection of data to a NOSQl database (MongoDB) manually using the mongo shell or using the MongoDB compass. Thanks to Prakash for his guidance and help towards the completion of my assignment

## Problem Encountered
The major problem during this excercise was how to go about solving task 3, I'm sure my peers would agree to that. We had done something similar in one of the workshops. So, I used the solution as a guide to solving task 3a. But the headache here was task 3b which I had no idea on how to go about or even find materials online to use as a guide until Our tutor( Prakash) provided his solution to task 3b. So much similarities in the solution provided and mine. 

### Solutions Found 

For the remaing Task the tutor was able to share his solutions, recommend where to get refesher courses on how to go about the assingment e.g W3schools for sql and recommending some videos on Linkedin learning. Google and Youtube provided so much help on how to go about the remaining tasks as there's always a video or a blog on how to go about the tasks. 

#### Python tools/Libraries that coul be used to visualize the data
Importing Pandas and matplotlib or seaborn would be the appropriate python tool or library to visualize the data. The  type of graphs that I'll recomend are density graph plot, histogram, scatter plot and pie graph.
